# Full-Stack Application Overview

## About the Application
    This project is a full-stack solution designed with NestJS for the backend, React for the frontend, and MongoDB for the database. The application is fully containerized using Docker, allowing for seamless deployment and execution with a single command.

### Technology Stack
#### Backend: Built with NestJS, handling phishing simulation and attempt tracking.
####   Frontend: Developed using React for user interfaces and interaction.
####  Database: MongoDB serves as the data storage for user information and phishing records.
####   Containerization: Docker ensures portability and easy environment setup.

 ## Prerequisites
### Please ensure following services installed on your system:
- Docker installed
- Node Js 20.x version

## 1. Clone the Repository
Start by cloning the repository and navigating to the project directory:

    git clone https://github.com/Alibek10599/phishing-test-task.git
    cd phishing

## 2. Set Up Environment Variables
Copy the example environment variable files and rename them to .env in the respective directories:


Backend:
    
    cd server
    touch .env


Frontend:

    cd client
    touch .env

You can copy the content for .env files from subsequent `.env.local` files

## 3. Launch the Application
Run the entire stack using Docker Compose:

    docker compose up -d

## 4. Access the Application
After starting, the application will be available on these endpoints:

Backend: http://localhost:8080
Frontend: http://localhost:3000

MongoDB: Connect via localhost:27017

How to Stop the Application

To stop and clean up the application, run:

    docker-compose down


Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are properly installed on your system.
Check Docker service status if containers fail to start.
Port Conflicts:

Verify that the default ports (3000, 8080, and 27017) are not already in use by other applications on your system.

With this setup, youâ€™re ready to run and explore the full-stack phishing simulation application. ðŸš€
